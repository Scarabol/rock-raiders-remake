# rock-raiders-remake  
JavaScript remake of the classic game "Lego Rock Raiders"  
  
Controls:  
-arrow keys to scroll the screen  
-left click to select a single unit or space  
-left click and drag to create a selection box to grab multiple units  
-right click a task while units are selected to have them perform that task, if possible  
The buttons on the top will change depending on your current selection, but most of them should be pretty intuitive :)  
  
to do:  
-Rewrite Raider Update method  
-Switch over to Task class so objects can have multiple simultaneous tasks  
-convert remaining level files and content from original game
